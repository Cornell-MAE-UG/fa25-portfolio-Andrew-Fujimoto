## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/SpaceForcePortrait.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Andrew Fujimoto. I am a third year mechanical engineering student at Cornell University and an officer select for the United States Space Force. I'm interested in military space missions, electromagnetic operations and the intersection of modern technology and warfare. I love to flex my creative side - I've had a love of Dungeons and Dragons from a young age and one of the great joys of my college life is creating new training scenarios for my reserve officer training corps (ROTC) unit. Above all, my greatest professional goal is to become a great leader of character. In a few short years I will enter a career where technical understanding will become secondary to effective leadership. I hope to prepare myself as much as possible for that switch.
