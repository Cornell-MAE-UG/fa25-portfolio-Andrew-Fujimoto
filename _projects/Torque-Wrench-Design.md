<p> As part of the curriculum of MAE 3270, mechanics of engineering materials, I worked with a partner to design, model, and test a torque wrench. The process started by writing MATLAB code to test different designs against the factor of safety criteria. After suitable dimensions were found, we used ANSYS to do finite element analysis on a CAD model of our design. Find a full writeup of the project below! </p>
