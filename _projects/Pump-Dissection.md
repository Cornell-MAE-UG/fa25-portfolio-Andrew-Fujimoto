<p> As the capstone project for fluid mechanics, I worked with a small group to take apart a centrifugal pump. We used theory from the class to analyze different components of the machine and showed how the theory intersected with the physical system. My part of the video included calculations of the specific speed and diameter of the pump, key nondimensionalized parameters that give insight into the use cases and best efficiency point of the pump. I also edited the entire video, utilizing skills in adobe premier pro deliver the final product. A link to the video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26rgSKUKajY </p>
