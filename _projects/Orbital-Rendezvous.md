<p> For our system dynamics capstone project, my group decided to model an orbital rendezvous between two satellites. Utilizing various skills from the class we used the Clohessy-Wilstshire equations to model the system. The model included state space equations, creating a block diagram, and writing a MATLAB script to animate the two satellites docking. The full writeup is linked below!
